ruby RUBY_VERSION

# Hello! This is where you manage which Bunto version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Bunto with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec bunto serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Bunto version is running.
# Happy Buntoing!
gem "bunto", "3.2.1"

# This is the default theme for new Bunto sites. You may change this to anything you like.
gem "minima"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "bunto"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
# gem "github-pages", group: :bunto_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
# group :bunto_plugins do
#   gem "bunto-github-metadata", "~> 1.0"
